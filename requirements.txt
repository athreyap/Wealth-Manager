pymupdf  # Also known as fitz - can convert PDF to images without Poppler

# ============================================================================
# SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (Required for OCR functionality)
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. POPPLER (Required for pdf2image):
#    Windows: Download from https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
#             Extract and add to PATH, or install via:
#             - Chocolatey: choco install poppler
#             - Scoop: scoop install poppler
#    
#    Linux: sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
#    Mac: brew install poppler
#
# 2. TESSERACT OCR (Optional, for Tesseract OCR):
#    Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#             Install and add to PATH
#    
#    Linux: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
#    Mac: brew install tesseract
#
# Note: EasyOCR works without system dependencies (pure Python)
#       but still needs pdf2image (which needs Poppler) to convert PDF to images
